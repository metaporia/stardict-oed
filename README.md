# Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (SOED) 6th Ed. & Oxford English Dictionary (OED) 2nd Ed.

This repo contains zips of the SOED 6th Ed. and OED 2nd Ed. in the stardict
format.

### Clients

The original StarDict client repo seems to be inactive. However, there actively
maintained clients for all platforms.

- [GoldenDict-ng](https://github.com/xiaoyifang/goldendict-ng) (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
  - both SOED and OED files work out of the box with GoldenDict. By
    default the styles (in article-styles.css) are not applied. Simply
    copy `{SOED,OED}rich.css` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/goldendict` and
    the styles will be applied on restart.
- [Universal Dictionary](https://dictionary-universal.appspot.com/dictionary/en)
  (iOS, can't recommend enough), automatically applies styles.
