# Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (SOED) 6th Ed. & Oxford English Dictionary (OED) 2nd Ed.

This repo contains zips of the SOED 6th Ed. and OED 2nd Ed. in the stardict
format. 

### Clients

The original StarDict client repo seems to be inactive. However, there actively
maintained clients for all platforms.

- GoldenDict (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
  - both SOED and OED files work out of the box with GoldenDict. By default the
    styles (in article-styles.css) are not applied. Simply copy
    `{SOED,OED}/article-styles.css` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/goldendict` and the
    styles will be applied on restart.
- Universal Dictionary (iOS, can't recommend enough), automatically applies
  styles.
